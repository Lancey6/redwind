## Post types

### Temporal

Sorted by time

* Note: quick thoughts
* Article: long form
* Bookmark/like: little or no content, rarely/never part of primary
  stream
* Photo: single photos like instagram or gallery

(Any of the above can be in-reply-to or repost-of, and can have a
location)

### Permanent

Sorted by category

* Page (e.g., for a project): Expected to keep up-to-date, like a wiki
  page

## <strike>Store images with post content</strike>

Saving to /static/uploads is lame.


## <strike>Address Book</strike>

Refer to people by name, autolink their domain or primary silo
profile, and include avatar.

Automatically discover linked profiles by rel-me -- keep up-to-date.

## Comment form

Logged-in users with a micropub endpoint should see a comment form on post 
permalink pages. Posted comments will be micropubbed to their site with 
u-in-reply-to set properly.

"Like" button too
