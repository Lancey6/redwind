Groomsman* is a (micro)-blogging engine used on my personal website,
kylewm.com. I have been using it to screw around with
[IndieWeb](http://indiewebcamp.com) ideas like POSSE (Twitter and
Facebook), microformats, webmentions (sending and receiving), and
backfeeding comments from silos (currently only Twitter).

* "Groomsman" because it's powered by a
  [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/). Yuk, yuk.
